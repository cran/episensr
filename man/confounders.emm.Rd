effect modification}
\usage{
confounders.emm(case, exposed, type = c("RR", "OR", "RD"),
  bias_parms = NULL, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{case}{Outcome variable. If a variable, this variable is tabulated against.}

\item{exposed}{Exposure variable.}

\item{type}{Choice of implementation, with no effect measure modification for
ratio measures (relative risk -- RR; odds ratio -- OR) or difference measures
(risk difference -- RD).}

\item{bias_parms}{Numeric vector defining the 4 necessary bias parameters. This
vector has 4 elements, in the following order:
\enumerate{
\item the association between the confounder and the outcome among those who
were exposed,
\item the association between the confounder and the outcome among those who
were not exposed,
\item the prevalence of the confounder among the exposed, and
\item the prevalence of the confounder among the unexposed.
}}

\item{alpha}{Significance level.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{obs.data}{The analyzed 2 x 2 table from the observed data.}
\item{cfder.data}{The same table for Confounder +.}
\item{nocfder.data}{The same table for Confounder -.}
\item{obs.measures}{A table of relative risk with confidence intervals; Total,
for Confounder +, and for Confounder -.}
\item{adj.measures}{A table of Standardized Morbidity Ratio and Mantel-Haenszel
estimates.}
\item{bias.parms}{Input bias parameters.}
}
\description{
Simple sensitivity analysis to correct for unknown or unmeasured confounding
with effect measure modification. Implementation for ratio measures (relative
risk -- RR, or odds ratio -- OR) and difference measures (risk difference -- RD).
