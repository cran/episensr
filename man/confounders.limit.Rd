\title{Bounding the bias limits of unmeasured confounding.}
\usage{
confounders.limit(
  p = NA,
  RR = NA,
  OR = NA,
  crude.RR = NULL,
  dec = 4,
  print = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Proportion with the confounder among the unexposed group.}

\item{RR}{Relative risk between the confounder and the outcome.}

\item{OR}{Odds ratio between the confounder and the outcome.}

\item{crude.RR}{Crude relative risk between the exposure and the outcome.}

\item{dec}{Number of decimals in the printout.}

\item{print}{A logical scalar. Should the results be printed?}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{conf.limits}{Limits on confounding.}
\item{bias.parms}{Input bias parameters p, RR, OR, and crude RR.}
}
\description{
Function to elicit the limits on measures of effect corrected for an unmeasured
confounder when only some of the bias parameters are known.
}
\examples{
confounders.limit(OR = 1.65, crude.RR = 1.5)
