\title{Bounding the bias limits of unmeasured confounding.}
\description{Function to elicit the limits on measures of effect
  corrected for an unmeasured confounder when only some of the bias
  parameters are known.}
\usage{
confounders.limit(p = NA, RR = NA, OR = NA, crude.RR = NULL, dec = 4, print = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{p}{Proportion with the confounder among the unexposed group.}
  \item{RR}{Relative risk between the confounder and the outcome.}
  \item{OR}{Odds ratio between the confounder and the outcome.}
  \item{crude.RR}{Crude relative risk between the exposure and the outcome.}
  \item{dec}{Number of decimals in the printout.}
  \item{print}{Should the results be printed?}
}
\value{A list with elements:
  \item{conf.limits}{Limits on confounding.}
  \item{bias.parms}{Input bias parameters p, RR, OR, and crude RR.}
